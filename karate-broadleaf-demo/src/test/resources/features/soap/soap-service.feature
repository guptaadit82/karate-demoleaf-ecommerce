# ðŸ§¼ What is SOAP?
# SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol used for accessing web services. It:

# Uses XML for request and response formats

# Relies on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to describe the service

# Works over HTTP/HTTPS

# Is more strict/formal than REST 
# âœ… Step-by-Step Guide to Start SOAP API Testing in Karate
# 1. Understand the WSDL File
# WSDL is like a contract that tells what services/methods are available.

# Usually accessible at a URL like:
# https://<host>/service?wsdl

# Broadleaf Commerce primarily offers RESTful APIs for its microservices architecture. However, it does provide SOAP-based integrations for specific services, notably the CyberSource Tax Module. This module utilizes SOAP APIs to calculate taxes during the checkout process.
